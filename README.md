A Swift based types for expressing/converting physical values in various units.

Main idea is to provide a way to work with meaningful values (length, time, angle and more..) rather than using abstract floating point values.  As a result there will be typesystem relied way to allow such operations as ``length + length``, ``length / time`` and deny such as ``length + time``, ``time - angle``.
